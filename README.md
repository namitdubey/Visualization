# Visualization
Data visualization is critical for diverse fields, from education to AI research to business management. It helps users analyze large data sets, recognize patterns and anomalies, and make informed decisions. By visualizing data, professionals can identify opportunities, pinpoint risks, and communicate insights effectively.

In this Project there are 4 taks 

Task 1: Conduct a thorough analysis of the provided datasets, utilizing appropriate tools and techniques to derive meaningful insights.
Task 2: Employ data cleaning techniques to ensure the datasets are accurate, complete, and consistent, utilizing both Excel and Python as needed.
Task 3: Create 10 distinct visualizations using the two datasets, each providing a unique representation of relevant data points from the corresponding dataframe.
Task 4: After completing each visualization, provide a detailed description outlining the specific column, dataframe source, and purpose of the representation, highlighting key insights gained from the visualized data.
